# UnsupervisedLearning-WGAN

## Introduction

This directory contains benchmarks based on Wasserstein GANs, a refinement to the original generative adversarial network.

GAN is an unsupervised learning model that uses two networks - a generator and a discriminator. As training progresses, the generator attempts to produce increasingly convincing data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between data produced by the generator and data from the original dataset.
